## Usage
To use the app, you need to select the amount of recoil you desire. You then click the START button to begin the macro.
The macro only works when pressing your left mouse button and right mouse button. To stop the macro you click the STOP
button. You can adjust it with the + or - buttons and reset to fully reset your amount.
